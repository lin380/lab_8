266,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen",1,Purchased this device at launch (2 pack for $384.xx) and now YouTube doesn't work. YouTube was one of the main features that I used. Without YouTube you'll be better off buying the $40 Echo Dot instead.
2508,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers, Black",1,My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed
2225,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers, Black",1,"I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible."
3165,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,1,Has a very good Bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she's pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions
2296,"Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers, Black",1,"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software."

3196,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,5,"Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it's portable! Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker."
4676,"Brand New Amazon Kindle Fire 16gb 7"" Ips Display Tablet Wifi 16 Gb Blue",5,My sister in-law recommended these to my wife and I and I thought I would try one. They are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while.
